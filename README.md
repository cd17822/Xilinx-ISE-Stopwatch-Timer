# Xilinx-ISE-Stopwatch-Timer

Final Project for Digital Logic Design (EECE 251) in which I used the Xilinix ISE Project Navigator to create a virtual schematic for a Papilio One board. 
Once uploaded, the Papilio acts as a stopwatch and programmable timer, able to be manipulated using the switches on the front of the board. The time is shown via the 7-segment display, and can be paused at any moment by pressing the joystick.
Diagrams, as well as some further instruction, are included in the main repository.

The folder labeled FINAL_FINAL_PROJECT is the project directory, which includes the full schematic along with components. Any components which are accompanied by a .vhd file, were provided by Binghamton University, all other content is original.

Final_Project.bit is the file that can ultimately be uploaded onto a Papilio One board.
